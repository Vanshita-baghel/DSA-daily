PROBLEM STATEMENT:
You are given a positive integer n, indicating that we initially have an n x n 0-indexed integer matrix mat filled with zeroes.

You are also given a 2D integer array query. For each query[i] = [row1i, col1i, row2i, col2i], you should do the following operation:

Add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (row1i, col1i) and the bottom right corner (row2i, col2i). That is, add 1 to mat[x][y] for all row1i <= x <= row2i and col1i <= y <= col2i.
Return the matrix mat after performing every query.

SOLUTION:

                                                                                            TIME COMPLEXITY: O(q*n + n*n)
                                                                                            SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n*n)

class Solution {
    // difference array technique (dat) 
    public int[][] rangeAddQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        int[][] grid= new int[n][n];
        for(int i=0; i<queries.length; i++){
            int row1= queries[i][0], row2= queries[i][2], col1= queries[i][1], 
            col2=queries[i][3];

            for(int j= row1; j<= row2; j++){
                grid[j][col1]+=1;
                if(col2+1<n){
                    grid[j][col2+1]-=1;
                }
            }
        }
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            
            for(int j=1; j<n; j++){
                grid[i][j]+= grid[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return grid;
    }
}
