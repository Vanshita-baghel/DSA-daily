PROBLEM STATEMENT:
You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m.

There are n packs where the ith pack contains apple[i] apples. There are m boxes as well, and the ith box has a capacity of capacity[i] apples.

Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.

Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.

SOLUTION:

                                                                                            TIME COMPLEXITY: O(m logm)
                                                                                            SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

class Solution {
    public int minimumBoxes(int[] apple, int[] capacity) {
        Arrays.sort(capacity);
        int cnt=0;
        int sum=0;
        for(int a: apple){
            sum+=a;
        }
        int m= capacity.length;
        int cap=0;
        for(int i=m-1; i>=0; i--){
            cap+= capacity[i];
            cnt++;
            if(cap>=sum){
                return cnt;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
