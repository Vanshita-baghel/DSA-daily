PROBLEM STATEMNENT:
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Select an index i and replace nums[i] with nums[i] - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by k.

SOLUTION:

                                                                                        TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
                                                                                        SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum=0;
        for(int num: nums){
            sum+= num;
        }
        return sum%k;
    }
}
