PROBLEM STATEMENT:
You are given a positive number n.

Return the smallest number x greater than or equal to n, such that the binary representation of x contains only set bits


SOLUTION:

                                                                                        TIME COMPLEXITYl O(1)
                                                                                        SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

class Solution {
    public int smallestNumber(int n) {
        

        int d=  (int)(Math.log(n)/Math.log(2));

        if(n== ((1 << (d+1))-1))   return n;
        else    return      (1<<(d+1))-1;
    }
}
