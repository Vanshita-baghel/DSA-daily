PROBLEM STATEMENT:
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

An array is considered balanced if the value of its maximum element is at most k times the minimum element.

You may remove any number of elements from nums​​​​​​​ without making it empty.

Return the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is balanced.

Note: An array of size 1 is considered balanced as its maximum and minimum are equal, and the condition always holds true.

SOLUTION:

                                                                                TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n*logn)
                                                                                SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
class Solution {
    public int minRemoval(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int maxSize=0;
        int l=0,r=0, n=nums.length;
        while(r<n){
            if(nums[r]<=(long)nums[l]*k){
                maxSize= Math.max(maxSize, r-l+1);
                r++;
            }
            else{
                l++;
            }
        }
        return n-maxSize;
    }
}
