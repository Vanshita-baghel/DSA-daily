PROBLEM STATEMENT:
We have two special characters:

The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.

SOLUTION:

                                                                                    TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
                                                                                    SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        
        int i=0, n= bits.length;
        boolean ans= true;

        while(i<n){
            if(bits[i]==1){
                //given bits[n-1]   can never be 1
                ans= false;
                i+=2;
            }
            else{
                ans= true;
                i++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
