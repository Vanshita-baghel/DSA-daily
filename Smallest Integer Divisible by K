PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

SOLUTION:

                                                                                      TIME COMPLEXITY: O(k)
                                                                                      SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

class Solution {
    public int smallestRepunitDivByK(int k) {
        if(k%2==0 || k%5==0)    return -1;

        int len=0, rem=0;

        while(true){
            len++;
            rem= (rem*10 +1)%k;
            if(rem==0)  return len;
        }
    }
}
