PROBLEM STATEMENT:
You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.

For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as follows:
abc
bce
cae
You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted, while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return the number of columns that you will delete.

SOLUTION:

                                                                                      TIME COMPLEXITY: O(r*c)
                                                                                      SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

class Solution {
    public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs) {
        int c= strs[0].length();
        int cnt=0, r= strs.length;
        for(int i=0; i<c; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<r-1; j++){
                String s1= strs[j], s2= strs[j+1];
                int ch1= s1.charAt(i)-'a', ch2= s2.charAt(i)-'a';
                if(ch1>ch2){
                    cnt++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
